-cr parameter cluster formats:
	1) if invariants are sorted according to similarity measure, defining ranges in cluster is sufficient e.g.: 1-5;6-16 means that c1 = {t1,..,t5}, c2={t6,...,16}
	2) if invariants are not sorted according to similarity measure, we can list invariant numbers or ranges (separating with comma) e.g.: 1,3,6-8;16-46 means that c1 = {t1,t3,t6,t7,t8}, c2={t16,...,t46}
